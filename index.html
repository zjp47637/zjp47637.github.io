	<hr>
<p>	Some of the greatest teams in college basketball history have been built around a strong group of upperclassmen, Juniors and Seniors.
	Teams such as Duke in the early 90's and UCLA during legendary coach John Wooden's tenure became dynasties due to their senior leadership.
	Nowadays, upper echelon teams are being plagued with players who are deemed as "One-and-Dones", or players that go to a school for one year as a pit stop on their way to the NBA.
	This leads to a large rate of turnover among these teams, and we are left with not recognizing a team from year to year.
	The youth of these teams is evident when they match up with an older, more experienced team, usually from a lower conference, and are upset.
	Coach's are being forced to reinitiate their gameplans each year and are not able to put these One-and-Dones through the full four year process to get them ready for professional basketball.</p>
	
<p>	Another way this rule is ruining the game is by creating less association of players with teams for the fans to cheer on.
	If a player becomes a star on the team, the fans can already expect him to declare for the NBA as soon as the year is over.
	Also, these players know beforehand that they will only be at the school for a year. How is a fan supposed to cheer for a team if they don't recognize half the players on the court each year?
	By the time the fan can associtae with the players, they're already leaving school for the pros.
	For example, this past season, Lonzo Ball, the point guard for UCLA who is projected as a top 2 pick in the upcoming draft, already knew before even getting on campus that he was going to the NBA after one season at UCLA.
	This left UCLA fans with only the hope that they could produce a championship this season, because they won't have a good chance after the young talent leave.
	On the other side, North Carolina, this year's national champion, was composed of a strong core of seniors and juniors leading the way. Their opponent, Gonzaga, was also made up like this which shows senior-led teams can do much better than teams filled with youth.</p>
	
<p>	Finally, this rule increases the chance of unprepared players entering the NBA and being out of the league within a couple of years and possessing no formal college education.
	Many of these players will have to reattend school to be able to get a normal desk job.
	Players go from playing agaisnt people that are their age and have a wide variety of talent ranging from moderate to elite to playing agaisnt the best basketball players in the world.
	Competition at this level increases vastly from college, and a 19 year old boy who is still developing may struggle against a full grown 30 year old man.
	Also, these players are accustomed to shorter games and seasons with limited travel.
	In the NBA, players can expect 82 game seasons with multiple trips cross country for few days rest between games compared to a 32 game season in college with at most two games in one week.
	This takes a toll on players especially with the physicality of the game at the professional level.</p>
	
<p>	The "One-and-Done" rule is ruining college basketball by giving us teams with fewer seniors, less fan association with the teams, and allowing unprepared players to enter the NBA.</p>
